# Binary Search
## Why Binary search exist in the first place
- We can do the same thing with O(n) time.
- If the problem states as sorted or monotonic fashion, we can apply binary search which can do the same thing with O(Logn) time, which is more optimized. 
## Basically there are 2 types of pattern exist in Binary Search

- Simple binary search
- Binary Search on Answers (monotonic property)

## Simple Binary Search (Traditional)
It's the usual binary search which can perform over the sorted or some kind of sorted array.

`one Should follow this order`

### Wohh!! You Learned the most favourite topic of Google
## Binary Search on Answers
- It's the trickier version of binary search which asks most of the time in interview and cp.

`one Should follow this order` 

#### How to identify Binary search on answer most of the time

- Minimize or maximize the answer
- Every one should get atleast one of the element
- Allocation should be contiguous in fashion (sometimes depends)
- Monotonic property (After a certain point, ans will not exist)
```bash
 F F T T T T T T T T F F F F . . . 
 ``` 

### There is basically two types of variation.

 #### Minimize the maximum

## Huraaahh, You're ready to crack Google

### Some points
- One should strugle with the problem/ try by your own before jumping the solution
- Learn intuitions and patterns, not questions.
